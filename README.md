# wallkey
Change desktop on osx with cmd, use unsplash or url

## Install

```yarn global add wallkey```

OR

```npm i -g wallkey```

## Use

#### set wallpaper the url
``` wallkey -u http://get.png```

#### search on unsplash and get a random img
``` wallkey ```

#### search on unsplash with a query and get a random img
``` wallkey -q music ```

## Troubleshooting
The command ran without any error, but the wallpaper didn't change? If you run the command in a full screen terminal, it won't change the other desktops' wallpaper. So try again in a minimised terminal.
